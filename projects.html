            <p class="card-text">This Scratch Project was created by Omer Ahmer (me) and my partner Vedant and was for our
            Computer Science Principles class. This project spanned from August 30, 2018, to September 7, 2018. The Scratch Project was my second experience
            programming, after doing an HTML and CSS project over the summer of 2017. For this project, we had to create an original game or 
            story using the Scratch programming language. This project was difficult for me because it was
            an entirely new language to me and I was not used to this type of programming. However, after getting feedback from people
            around me and asking for help, I got the hang of it. For our project, Vedant and I chose to create and obstacle game, sort of
            like Happy Wheels or Fancy Pants. I took charge of the graphical portion of the game, while Vedant worked on the physics. Since
            hitting the obstacles was actually part of the visuals, I consulted my friends numerous times to see if the game was too hard, 
            too easy, or just unplayable. Overall, this project was enjoyable and gave me a different viewpoint on coding. Instead of
            just coding everything and turning it in for a grade, I learned that we need to consult with others, recieve feedback, and
            improve our application/website based on the criticisms we get. <br></br>

            <p class="card-text">This App Inventor Project was created by me and my partner Riya and was for our Computer
            Science Principles class. This project spanned from September 18, 2018, to October 5, 2018.
            For this project, we had to take an App Inventor original tutorial and modify it to make it our own. 
            This time, I had to take charge of the physics and visuals of the game, while Riya had to write the documentation.
            We chose to do Mole Mash, since there were many things we could change. For our beta version, we added
            a pause, play, and reset button. We also added a mole which you were not supposed to touch, which was a picture of
            Mr. Brown. We had a few bugs, such as the moles overlapping and the play button refusing to work. We
            got feedback from our friends, and they said we had to fix some minor bugs they noticed and add some more of our own functions
            to make it more unique. To do that, we also added a slower and faster button so the moles move at different
            speeds. Also, we got rid of the fixed holes so that the moles could move freely on the screen and would
            never overlap. From this project, I learned how to take lead of a project and help my partner understand how everything
            works. I also learned how to take feedback and turn it into useful work, and lead by example. <br></br>
