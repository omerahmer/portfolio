            <p class="card-text">This App Inventor Project was created by me and my partner Riya.
            For this project, we had to take an App Inventor original tutorial and modify it to make it our own.
            We chose to do Mole Mash, since there were many things we could change. For our beta version, we added
            a pause, play, and reset button. We also added a mole which you were not supposed to touch, which was 
            Mr. Brown. We had a few bugs, such as the moles overlapping and the play button refusing to work. We
            got feedback from our friends, and they said we had to fix the bugs and add some more of our own things
            to make it more unique. To do that, we also added a slower and faster button so the moles move at different
            speeds. Also, we got rid of the fixed holes so that the moles could move freely on the screen and would
            never overlap.
