            <p class="card-text">This Java project created by Omer Ahmer (me) and my partners Anish Shivamurthy and Eshan Bathula was for our
            AP Computer Science Applications class. This project spanned from October 2020 to November 26, 2020. For this project, we had to create an 
            educational game in Java to demonstrate our knowledge in Java. We utilized primitive data types, conditionals, void and non-void methods,
            the Greenfoot GUI/IDE. The objective of the game is to hit the elements in the pre-selected group only. For example, if the player is given
            the group of metals, they should only hit the metals that are "falling down" from the "sky" (e.g gold, silver, iron, etc.) If the player hits 
            a certain amount of wrong elements, the game will end and the user will be prompted to study more so that they can get the answers right.
            This project taught all of us how to work in a group and individual setting and how to manage our time so that we each finish our tasks on time.<br></br>

            <p class="card-text">This Java project was created by me and my partners Anish Shivamurthy and Eshan Bathula
            for our AP Computer Science Applications class. This project spanned from October 15, 2020 to October 22, 2020.
            For this project, we had to demonstrate our knowledge of string manipulation and everything we had learned before that
            in Java. We utilized string manipulation, non-void methods, and conditionals to complete this project. The objective
            is to give the user a mad lib based on a number they pick. When they pick the number, they are given a mad lib and some
            hints to solve it. Once they enter all of the appropriate values, the final mad lib is returned to them through the
            terminal to show the result. This project taught us how to work in an individual setting and how we should communicate
            with one another to solve problems and bring the code together into one functioning program.<br></br>
